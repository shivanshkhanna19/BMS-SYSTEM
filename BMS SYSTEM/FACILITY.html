<h2 style="color:WHITE;"> <center> What Ameneties Are Expected By Passengers On the Bus?</center></h2>
<p class="ex1" style="font-family:italic">Being inside our buses is not really different from being inside a plane. The vehicles are no longer old and rusty but are mostly equipped with comfortable seats and enough leg space. our bus company, for instance, offers reclining leather seats on their new fleet. Old vehicles, which are still in use, have been updated: A whole row of seats was taken out so that passengers can enjoy more space and thus a heightened level of comfort.

  If you like a good view while riding the bus or you’re simply very picky when it comes to choosing the perfect seat, then that's our main focus . Our bus company allows you to reserve the seat of your choice on many connections. So if you want to sit at the very front of a double decker bus, then an additional five bucks per ticket is charged. If you’re a family of four and enjoy playing card games or doing jigsaw puzzles, then you can opt for four seats around a table. This only costs hundered bucks per ticket extra.
<h2 style="color:WHITE;"> <center>  Entertainment Options </center></h2>
<p class="ex1" style="font-family:italic">

Our bus company provides you the best entertainment options and facilities on board of their vehicles.  for instance, we  provide free WiFi on your bus journeys so that passengers can browse the internet or upload travel selfies on Facebook and Instagram.We boasts itself of power outlets on nearly every single seat. On selected buses  customers can even make use of a DVD player or an XM radio in addition to the free WiFi. Boredom is a thing of the past thanks to these entertainment options!
 That's our all entertaiment options.


<h2 style="color:WHITE;"> <center>  What Additional Services and Facilities are Available? </center></h2>
<p class="ex1" style="font-family:italic">
A bus is no longer just a bus. There’s numerous additional services that customers can make use of. If you travel via our service, you can use a parking service called Parking Panda so that there’s a reserved parking space waiting for you close to the bus stop. If you want to reach your destination as quickly as possible, then our company  is the right option: On selected routes the bus company offers non-stop or few-stop bus routes reducing the duration of your journey considerably. But buses are not only useful for people who want to travel: Some of the bus companies also offer parcel services allowing you to ship larger packages for little money. One of the most well-known ones is certainly the  Package Express service. But our service , for instance, also allows you to send packages. If you want to send a 50lbs. package via next-day delivery from Chennai,to Delhi MT it will only cost you 680 bucks, which is much cheaper than shipping something via plane. Sometimes you can also benefit from a discount if you are on the same bus as your parcel. That way, taking oversized or overweight luggage is no problem at all! in our bus service
